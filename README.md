##About 

A Spring Boot application is a Java-based web application framework that provides a comprehensive infrastructure for developing and deploying web applications quickly and easily. The application uses RESTful architecture to expose resources as web services that can be consumed by clients over HTTP.

The application is a to-do list manager with a Board and Tasks. The Board is the main container that holds the tasks. Each task is a separate entity that can be added, modified, or removed. The Board and Tasks are represented as RESTful resources, with each resource having its own URI.
